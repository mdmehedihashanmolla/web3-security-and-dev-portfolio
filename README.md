# 🛡️ Web3 Security & Development Portfolio

Welcome to my **Proof-of-Work portfolio** — built to showcase my skills as a Smart Contract Security Researcher and Developer.  
This repo contains everything from vulnerability PoCs to dev projects, competitive audits, and custom tooling.

> 💡 "I don’t tell people I’m skilled — I show them with code, tests, and writeups."
