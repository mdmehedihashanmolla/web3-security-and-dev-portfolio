# 🛡️ Web3 Security & Dev Portfolio

Welcome to my **Proof-of-Work portfolio** as a Smart Contract Security Researcher and Developer.  
Everything here is built with intention — from audit contests and CTFs to real vulnerabilities and dev projects.

> 🚀 _This is not a resume — it's a trail of real work._
