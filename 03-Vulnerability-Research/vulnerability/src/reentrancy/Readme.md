# REENTRANCY ATTACKS

</div>

## 1. Single Function Reentrancy

Single Function Reentrancy happens when a malicious contract keeps calling the same function in a vulnerable contract again and again before the first call is finished.

Because the contract hasn't updated its records yet, the attacker can trick it into running the same logic multiple times in one transaction. This usually lets the attacker steal funds or mess with the contract's state in ways the developer didn't intend.

### Mitigation Guide

- **CEI**: Checks → Effects (all state changes) → Interactions (calls).
- **ReentrancyGuard**: `nonReentrant` modifier for locks.
- **Pull Payments**: Users claim funds separately.
- **Safe Transfers**: Use `transfer()` (2300 gas limit) over `call`.

## 2. Cross-Function Reentrancy

Cross-Function Reentrancy is a type of reentrancy vulnerability in Solidity smart contracts where an external call from one function allows an attacker to reenter a different function in the same contract before the initial function completes its state updates. This exploits shared state variables across functions, leading to inconsistent or manipulated state that benefits the attacker, such as double-spending or unauthorized actions.

### Mitigation Guide

- **CEI Everywhere**: Apply Checks → Effects → Interactions globally.
- **Protect Entry Points**: Add `nonReentrant` to all state-modifying externals.
- **Use Pull over Push**: Avoid callbacks, let users withdraw.
- **Snapshot State**: Copy balances/state before calls, update safely after.
