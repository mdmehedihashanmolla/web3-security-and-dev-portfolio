# REENTRANCY ATTACKS

</div>

## 1. Single Function Reentrancy

Single Function Reentrancy happens when a malicious contract keeps calling the same function in a vulnerable contract again and again before the first call is finished.

Because the contract hasn't updated its records yet, the attacker can trick it into running the same logic multiple times in one transaction. This usually lets the attacker steal funds or mess with the contract's state in ways the developer didn't intend.

### Mitigation Guide

- **CEI**: Checks → Effects (all state changes) → Interactions (calls).
- **ReentrancyGuard**: `nonReentrant` modifier for locks.
- **Pull Payments**: Users claim funds separately.
- **Safe Transfers**: Use `transfer()` (2300 gas limit) over `call`.
